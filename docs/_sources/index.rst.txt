Welcome to Qt-Anser
==================================
Qt-Anser is the graphical user interface (GUI) for the Anser System, built using the PyQt platform.

The aim of the Anser project is to provide an open-source implementation for electromagnetic tracking with particular application to image-guided interventions. The system is compatible with commercially available EMT sensors as well as the Open Network Interface for Image-Guided Therapy (OpenIGTLink) for easy communication with visualisation toolkits such as MITK and 3D Slicer.
