# Qt-Anser

**Qt-Anser** is the graphical user interface (GUI) for the [Anser EMT System](https://anser.io/#/), built using the PyQt platform. 

Go to the [Qt-Anser Homepage ](https://stephenhinds.github.io/qt-anser/) to download the application, 
read the documentation or view system manual.  

The aim of the Anser project is to provide an open-source implementation for electromagnetic tracking with particular application to image-guided interventions. The system is compatible with commercially available EMT sensors as well as the Open Network Interface for Image-Guided Therapy (OpenIGTLink) for easy communication with visualisation toolkits such as CustusX, MITK and 3D Slicer.
